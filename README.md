# Design-and-Control-of-a-Razor-Clam-Like-Underwater-Jet-Propulsion-Robot-Fish
This work designs a bionic jet-propelled robot inspired by the razor clam. It mimics the clamâ€™s water-jet motion using a magnetic-driven shell and flexible membrane. A second design uses a tubular origami structure to simulate foot contraction. Both were optimized, 3D printed, and tested.
