# Design-and-Control-of-a-Razor-Clam-Like-Underwater-Jet-Propulsion-Robot-Fish
This work presents the design of a bionic jet-propelled robot inspired by the razor clam (Sinonovacula constricta), aiming to replicate its unique jet-based locomotion for underwater motion.

First, the biological structure and movement of the razor clam were analyzed. When threatened, the clam performs a rapid escape by whipping its foot and ejecting water through its siphon, reaching a speed of about 50 cm/s. High-speed imaging shows that the foot movement rotates the body by 90¬∞, positioning the shell opening downward while the siphon‚Äîlocated between the foot and mantle‚Äîexpels water to reduce ground friction.

Based on this mechanism, a jet-propelled robotic prototype was designed. Using SolidWorks, a magnetic drive system was created in which a motor-driven rotor with permanent magnets controls the opening and closing of the upper shell. The shell motion compresses a flexible membrane to simulate the clam‚Äôs mantle contraction and water ejection. Fluid dynamics simulations in Fluent were conducted to analyze flow characteristics, thrust, and efficiency, followed by structural optimization and prototype fabrication for testing.

A second design concept was later proposed using a tubular origami-like structure to imitate the clam‚Äôs foot contraction, generating thrust by expelling water through a nozzle. The model was also optimized and 3D printed for experimental verification.

Finally, comparative tests between the two prototypes were carried out, and the propulsion performance and movement stability were comprehensively analyzed.

## üåä Bio-Inspiration & Motivation  

Razor clams exhibit a **composite propulsion** combining:  
1. **Foot whipping** ‚Äî rotates the body 90¬∞ about the longitudinal axis  
2. **Jet ejection** ‚Äî mantle contraction expels stored water through the siphon  

This efficient escape mechanism inspired the development of a **bionic jet-propelled robot** that mimics the clam‚Äôs dual action for underwater locomotion.
