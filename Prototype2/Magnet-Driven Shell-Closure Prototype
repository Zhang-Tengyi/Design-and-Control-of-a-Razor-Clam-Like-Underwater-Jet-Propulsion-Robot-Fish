Goal: Mimic the clam’s outer membrane contraction via shell closure.
Design Idea:

Designed upper–lower shell linked by an elastic film forming a sealed chamber.

Used rotating permanent magnets to periodically open/close the shell, generating a water-jet propulsion cycle.
Key Challenges & Solutions:

Problem: Electromagnets lacked force and efficiency underwater.
Solution: Switched to a permanent magnet + rotor drive design.

Problem: Low thrust efficiency.
Solution: Optimized nozzle size (700 mm²) and rotation speed (60 rpm), achieving the best balance between speed and stability.
Tools: SolidWorks, MATLAB, STC89C52RC microcontroller, Fluent CFD.
Result: Achieved ~19 mm/s stable motion with controllable periodic propulsion
